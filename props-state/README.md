# First Section - Props and State

In this section we will see two fundamental aspects of react, `props` and `state`.
Before that we will understand what JSX is and how to write a React component in it. To achieve that we will use the online [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl) transpiler.

## Props

Props, a way of passing data from parent to child.
Think about it as a communication layer between components always moving from top (parent) to bottom (child). One more characteristic of props is that are immutable data structures.

##State

State, is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object called `this.state`. When we mutate the state object the component will re-render.
